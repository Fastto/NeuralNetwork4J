# The SImple implementation of the Neural Network for Java


## Features:
1. Mutation
2. Crossing
3. Education by back propagation method
4. Unlimited Network depth
5. Unlimited Network width
6. Individual width of the each Layer of the Network

## Usage

## Example project
### Simulation of evolution 
https://github.com/Fastto/SimulationOfEvolution. 

It implements genetic algorithm with crossing and mutation.

### Separation the surface by color zones based on several points
IN PROGRESS

The implementation uses propagation method of education
